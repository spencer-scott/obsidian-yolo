/**
 * MCP-only desktop fetch backed by Chromium's `globalThis.fetch` so that
 * `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` receives a working WHATWG `ReadableStream`
 * body for SSE streaming.
 *
 * Why not undici: undici@6 in Electron renderer has multiple incompatibilities
 * — timer `.unref()` crash and chunked-body decoder not pumping data through.
 * Chromium fetch handles SSE natively and uses the system proxy automatically
 * (Electron resolves it via Chromium's network stack), which covers the common
 * case (macOS system proxy, Clash TUN/system mode, Windows network proxy, etc).
 *
 * Trade-off: shell-only `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` env vars without an
 * accompanying system proxy are not honored. Affected users should configure
 * the proxy at the OS / Clash system level.
 *
 * Why not Obsidian `requestUrl`: it is buffered (no ReadableStream), which
 * silently breaks SSE consumption in the SDK.
